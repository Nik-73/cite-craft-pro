## The Matilda Effect

### What Is It?
The **Matilda Effect** is a phenomenon coined by historian Margaret Rossiter in 1993, named after suffragist Matilda Gage (whose own work was overlooked by historians). It describes the systematic denial or minimization of credit to women scientists for their contributions, with male colleagues often receiving the recognition instead.

### Key Examples:
1. **Rosalind Franklin** - DNA structure discovery credited to Watson & Crick
2. **Lise Meitner** - Nuclear fission credited to Otto Hahn
3. **Chien-Shiung Wu** - Conservation of Parity disproof; Nobel Prize to male colleagues
4. **Alice Ball** - Leprosy treatment credited to university president
5. **Maria Kirch** - Comet discovery attributed to her husband

### Academic Recognition:
Rossiter's 1993 paper has been cited in hundreds of subsequent studies. The phrase "Matilda Effect" is now widely used in academic discussions of gender bias in science.

### Related Concept - The Matthew Effect:
The opposite phenomenon where eminent scientists receive disproportionate credit for contributions, while unknown or junior researchers are overlooked.
