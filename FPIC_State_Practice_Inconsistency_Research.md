# Comprehensive Research on State Practice Regarding FPIC
## Demonstrating Inconsistency in Accepting FPIC as Binding Customary International Law

**Research Date:** November 11, 2025
**Total Examples Documented:** 60+

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This research demonstrates substantial inconsistency and non-uniform state practice regarding Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) as a binding obligation under customary international law. The evidence shows:

1. **Initial rejection** of UNDRIP by major states (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand)
2. **Explicit state statements** characterizing FPIC as non-binding and aspirational
3. **Domestic legislation** limiting Indigenous rights to consultation without veto/consent
4. **Court rulings** affirming consultation suffices; consent not required
5. **Continued approval** of extractive projects despite Indigenous opposition
6. **Rejection** of UN treaty body recommendations on FPIC

## 2. NATIONAL LEGISLATION AND CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS

### 2.1 CANADA: Consultation Framework WITHOUT Consent/Veto

#### 2.1.1 Constitutional Duty to Consult (2004)

**Case:** Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511

**Supreme Court Holding:**
The Supreme Court established that **"the duty to consult and, where appropriate, accommodate does not give Indigenous groups a veto over final Crown decisions."**

**Key Quote:**
"This process [of consultation] does not give Aboriginal groups a veto over what can be done with land pending final proof of the claim. The Aboriginal 'consent' spoken of in Delgamuukw is appropriate only in cases of established rights, and then by no means in every case."

**Source:** Library of Parliament Research Publications, Indigenous Consultation and Consent in Canadian Law

#### 2.1.2 Bill C-15: UNDRIP Implementation Act (2021)

**Legislation:** United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act
**Royal Assent:** June 21, 2021

**Government Official Statements on "No Veto":**

**Minister Lametti (Second Reading):**
"Free, prior and informed consent **does not constitute veto power** over the government's decision-making process."

**Department of Justice Position:**
FPIC "is **not about having a veto** over government decision-making" but rather "an obligation to work together in good faith toward mutually acceptable arrangements."

**Key Provisions:**
- FPIC is described as "striving to achieve consensus"
- "Not about having a veto over government decision-making"
- Recent court decisions clarified FPIC is "not a veto or a right to a particular outcome, it is a right to a robust process directed towards finding mutual agreement"

**Source:** openparliament.ca, Department of Justice Canada, BLG legal analysis

#### 2.1.3 Aboriginal Consultation and Accommodation Guidelines (2011)

**Document:** "Aboriginal Consultation and Accommodation - Updated Guidelines for Federal Officials to Fulfill the Duty to Consult"
**Date:** March 2011

**Key Provisions:**
- Establishes "spectrum of consultation" based on strength of claim and impact
- Even "deeper consultation" may require "securing the full consent" only in limited circumstances
- Consultation requirements vary but do not generally amount to veto power

**Source:** Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada

### 2.2 UNITED STATES: No FPIC Standard Adopted

#### 2.2.1 Federal Framework

**Current Law:**
The United States has **not adopted the FPIC standard** from UNDRIP.

**Consultation Requirements:**
- Federal-tribal consultation is codified in "some statutes, orders, regulations, and policies"
- "No consistent consultation procedure or policy"
- "Current piecemeal approach only gives the façade of requiring tribal input"
- "US agencies are free to offer minimal consultation procedures and go ahead with their proposed decisions as a matter of administrative discretion"

**Assessment:**
"While the ideal goal for Native Americans is to give FPIC before action is taken that affects their land, resources, or culture, **it appears that the federal government will not take that leap in the near future.**"

**Source:** Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights, Harvard Law Review

#### 2.2.2 Supreme Court Precedent: Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823)

**Case:** Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. 543 (1823)

**Holding:**
The Supreme Court held that the federal government has the exclusive right to negotiate the transfer of land from American Indian tribes, determining that tribes had a **"title of occupancy"** rather than ownership.

**Ongoing Impact:**
This "doctrine of discovery" continues to limit Indigenous land rights in U.S. law.

**Source:** List of U.S. Supreme Court cases involving Indian tribes

### 2.3 AUSTRALIA: Native Title Act and Heritage Laws

#### 2.3.1 Native Title Act 1993 (Cth)

**Framework:**
- Future acts regime allows government to approve development despite Indigenous opposition
- Does not require consent from Indigenous landholders
- Only requires "consultation and negotiation"

**Current Status:**
The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) is examining whether the future acts regime "adequately reflects internationally recognised principles of human rights, including FPIC."

**Gap Assessment:**
"While there are a number of state and federal laws that concern protection of cultural heritage, native title and Indigenous engagement, **in all cases there is a gap between domestic law and international FPIC standards.**"

**Source:** Allens law firm, ANTAR

#### 2.3.2 Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 (Western Australia)

**Juukan Gorge Case (2020):**

**Incident:** Rio Tinto destroyed 46,000-year-old rock shelters on May 24, 2020

**Legal Status:**
"One of the most devastating aspects of the Juukan Gorge destruction was this: **Rio Tinto acted within the law**. In 2013, Rio Tinto received ministerial consent to destroy the Juukan Gorge caves under WA's Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972."

**Parliamentary Inquiry (2020-2021):**
- Report titled "Never Again" and "A Way Forward"
- Found Indigenous peoples "were let down" by mining company, WA government, federal government, their own lawyers, and Native Title law itself
- "Highlights the disparity in power between Indigenous peoples and industry in the protection of Indigenous heritage"

**Outcome:**
- Seven recommendations including moratorium and compensation
- CEO and two executives stepped down
- However, **the destruction was legal under existing law**

**Source:** Senate inquiry reports, ANTAR, HRLC

### 2.4 NEW ZEALAND: Resource Management Act 1991

#### 2.4.1 Consultation Requirements

**Statutory Framework:**
- **Section 8:** All persons exercising functions under RMA must "take into account" Treaty of Waitangi principles
- **Section 36A:** Explicitly states "there is **no duty to consult** any person about resource consent applications"

**Court Interpretation:**

**Beadle Case:**
Court held that consultation requires "a fair and meaningful process" but:
- "Does not require the parties to negotiate or agree"
- "Does not give tangata whenua a right of veto over the project"

**General Principle:**
"Consultation with Māori is required in application of the Treaty principle of partnership, but **it does not give Māori a veto** over proposals the subject of resource consent applications."

**Source:** New Zealand Ministry for the Environment, Environment Court decisions

### 2.5 NORDIC COUNTRIES: Sami Consultation Laws

#### 2.5.1 Sweden: Consultation Order (2022)

**Legislation:** Sami Parliament Consultation Order
**Adopted:** January 26, 2022

**Key Provisions:**
The consultation law "allows consultations to end without the government and the Sami reaching consensus when it is determined that consensus cannot be reached, and thus **the law does not confer a veto right** on Sami representatives."

**Criticism:**
Several stakeholders including Amnesty International stated that "not requiring consent from Sami representatives **violates customary international law** pertaining to indigenous rights."

**ILO Convention 169:**
Sweden has **not ratified** the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989 (ILO169).

**Source:** Library of Congress Global Legal Monitor, Swedish Parliament

#### 2.5.2 Finland: Sami Parliament Act

**Framework:**
Finland's legislation "does not afford the Sami Parliament a **power of veto** over the national Finnish Parliament."

**Recent Developments:**
- October 2024: UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights found Finland violated Sámi rights
- Domestic law still does not provide veto power

**Source:** IWGIA reports, UN treaty body decisions

#### 2.5.3 Norway: Consultation Agreement (2005)

**Agreement:** Between Sámediggi and Norwegian Government (2005)

**Requirements:**
- State authorities must provide "full information concerning relevant matters"
- Consultations should continue "as long as the Sami Parliament and State authorities consider that it is possible to achieve an agreement"

**However:**
- Does not provide veto power
- Consultations can end without agreement

**Source:** Sami Parliament documentation

#### 2.5.4 Nordic Countries Joint Position

**Joint Statement:**
The Nordic countries stated that the UNDRIP provision on FPIC "should **not be regarded as according indigenous peoples a general 'veto power'** over decisions that may affect them, but rather as establishing consent as the objective of consultations with indigenous peoples."

**Source:** Norway UN Geneva mission statements

### 2.6 LATIN AMERICA

#### 2.6.1 Colombia: Decree 1320 of 1998

**Background:**
- Colombia ratified ILO Convention 169 in 1991
- New Constitution (1991) accepted FPIC principles

**However:**
**Decree 1320 of 1998** was passed **without consulting indigenous peoples**

**Response:**
- ILO Committee of Experts requested government not apply the decree
- Colombian Constitutional Court requested the same
- Demonstrates gap between constitutional provisions and implementation

**Consultation Practice:**
Colombia reports "more than eight hundred consultations" between 2010-2013, making it "number one in the world in the realization of consultation processes," yet many Indigenous communities report consultations are inadequate.

**Source:** Dejusticia, academic studies on Latin American consultation

#### 2.6.2 Mexico: Energy Reform (2013-2014)

**Legislative Changes:** 2013 constitutional amendments and 2014 Hydrocarbons Law

**Consultation Requirements:**
Both laws "include a chapter on land use and occupancy, which requires social impact evaluations and public consultation"

**However:**
**Problem:** "These consultations were carried out **after the planning and design of projects** and became **mere formalities**, leading affected peoples to sue in court for lack of consultation free of pressure, prior to project design."

**Legal Challenges:**
- Since 2016: Indigenous farmers blocked energy projects through legal action
- Since 2018: Communities stopped at least six renewable projects in Yucatan and a hydroelectric plant in Puebla
- Puebla 1 hydroelectric plant blocked through lawsuit arguing "mandatory indigenous consultation was not carried out"

**Source:** Transnational Institute, Lexology

#### 2.6.3 Chile: ILO Convention 169 Implementation

**Year Ratified:** 2009

**Key Issues:**
- "Several court decisions have led to sanctions for extractive projects because they did not consult"
- However, consultations often inadequate
- Out of 120 active mineral mine projects in Argentina and Chile, over 50% (61) are in conflict
- In Chile, US$12 billion of investments contested, with 21% held up in justice system

**Mining Concessions:**
Despite consultation requirements, mining companies have "appropriated available water rights, siphoning off rivers and tapping scarce water supplies" affecting Indigenous communities.

### 2.7 JAPAN: Ainu Policy Promotion Act (2019)

**Legislation:** Act on Promotion of Measures to Realize a Society in Which the Pride of the Ainu People is Respected
**Effective:** August 1, 2019

**Recognition:**
First law recognizing Ainu as Indigenous peoples of Japan

**Critical Gap:**
**"There is no domestic legislative or policy base that stipulates any requirement on the part of the Japanese government to consult the Ainu."**

**UNDRIP Standards Not Met:**
- UNDRIP provides states must obtain FPIC "before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures"
- "The Japanese government has been criticized for failing to do just this"
- Law "does not guarantee any rights included in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples"

**Participation Issues:**
- Policy development conducted "behind closed doors"
- "Limited" Ainu participants
- Those not participating "left in the dark as to the decision-making process"

**Source:** Library of Congress, Michigan State University International Law Review

### 2.8 RUSSIA: Indigenous Peoples Rights

**Legal Framework:**
- Federal law (2001) on Territories of Traditional Nature Use
- Public hearings and consultations required by Russian law before industrial projects

**However:**

**UN Human Rights Committee (noted):**
"Consultation with indigenous peoples on matters of interest to their communities is **insufficiently enforced in practice**"

**Key Failures:**
- Federal Government has **not registered a single** Territory of Traditional Nature Use as required by 2001 federal law
- Over 500 TTNU established by local/regional government "have no guaranteed legal status"
- Not recognized by Ministry for Natural Resources, which issues resource use licenses

**Arctic Development:**
"Indigenous peoples are **not mentioned in Arctic legislation** despite the fact it will determine conditions for socio-economic development of vast Arctic territory inhabited by indigenous peoples."

**Source:** IWGIA reports, UN Human Rights Committee

### 2.9 CHINA: No Recognition of Indigenous Peoples

**Official Position:**
China voted in support of UNDRIP in 2007, but then **"promptly disavowed any obligation under the declaration, proclaiming there were no indigenous peoples in China."**

**Key Statement:**
China "proclaimed 5,000 years of unity and harmony with its 55 designated national minorities living in peace on their own land."

**Sovereignty Shield:**
"Using sovereignty as a shield, the People's Republic of China has generally sought a pass in regard to enforcing international human rights compliance...This avoidance has nowhere been more absolute than its **disavowal of any obligations regarding indigenous peoples' rights.**"

**Tibet and Xinjiang:**
- Law on National Regional Autonomy applies to 55 minorities
- "Heavy-handed direct control" practiced in Tibet and Xinjiang
- Research shows "Internal Colonialism" imposed by Chinese state
- No consultation mechanisms for resource extraction

His reports to the Human Rights Council between 2009 and 2013 "repeatedly encouraged indigenous peoples to organize themselves institutionally for consultations and FPIC processes."

#### 4.1.4 Indigenous Resistance

"Across the globe indigenous peoples are continuing to resist extractive industry operations, and in many cases they **resist entering into consultations over proposed extractive activities for fear of being forced down a path of acceptance** of extractive activities that they do not want near them."

**Three Conditions Required:**
1. "Effective participation of the members of the indigenous community in conformity with their customs and traditions"
2. "State must guarantee that benefits from any development must also benefit them"
3. "State must undertake a prior environmental and social impact assessment"

**Contrast:**
"Most successful Sami rights cases have come from **UN human rights bodies rather than the European Court of Human Rights**."

## 8. ADDITIONAL STATE POSITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS

### 8.1 ILO Convention 169 Interpretation

**Official ILO Position:**
"Such consultations **do not imply a right to veto** nor is the result of the consultations necessarily the reaching of agreement or consent."

**Explicit Statement:**
"Convention No. 169 **does not provide indigenous peoples with a veto right**, as obtaining the agreement or consent is the purpose of engaging in the consultation process, and is **not an independent requirement**."

**Historical Context - Drafting:**
During redrafting, "Indigenous groups argued for the inclusion of the terms **'consent and control'**...but government and business representatives did not agree and offered instead the terms **'consultation and participation'**."

**Indigenous Criticism:**
"Under Convention 169, governments must consult Indigenous peoples...but it **does not give Indigenous peoples the right to veto** such projects, and many Indigenous representatives feel that their **lack of veto power allows governments too much freedom** to do as they please."

**Source:** ILO documentation, academic studies

### 8.2 World Bank / IFC Performance Standards

**Key Principle:**
"States have the **right to make decisions on the development of resources pursuant to applicable national law**, and Performance Standard 7 **does not contradict the state's right to develop its resources**."

**Distinction:**
"State-level FPIC obligations are **distinct from the project-level FPIC requirements** described in Performance Standard 7. The Performance Standards apply to **private sector clients receiving IFC financing, not to states themselves**."

**Binding Nature:**
IFC Performance Standards are **not binding on states**, only on private sector project proponents seeking IFC financing.

**Source:** IFC Sustainability Framework documentation

### 8.3 United Kingdom Position

**Official Position:**
UK maintains that "**national minority groups, and other ethnic groups within the territory of the United Kingdom, and its overseas territories, do not fall within the scope of indigenous people**, to which UNDRIP applies."

**Ambassador Karen Pierce Statement:**
- "The Declaration was **non-legally binding**"
- "Did not propose to have any retroactive application on historical episodes"
- "National minority groups and other ethnic groups within the territory of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories **did not fall within the scope** of the indigenous peoples to which the Declaration applied"

**Source:** UK Parliament, UN statements

### 8.4 Japan Position

**Implementation Gap:**
"There is **no domestic legislative or policy base that stipulates any requirement** on the part of the Japanese government to consult the Ainu."

**UNDRIP Standards:**
"UNDRIP provides that 'States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples...to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them,' however, **the Japanese government has been criticized for failing to do just this**."

## 10. CONCLUSION

This research demonstrates **substantial, widespread, and persistent inconsistency** in state practice regarding FPIC as a binding obligation under customary international law.

### Key Findings:

1. **Initial Opposition:** Major Western democracies (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) initially voted against UNDRIP, explicitly citing concerns about FPIC as veto power.

2. **Qualified Support:** When these states later endorsed UNDRIP, they explicitly characterized it as "non-binding," "aspirational," and "not customary international law."

3. **Domestic Law Gaps:** States across all continents have adopted consultation frameworks that explicitly reject veto/consent requirements, limiting Indigenous rights to consultation only.

4. **Judicial Interpretation:** Highest courts in multiple jurisdictions (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, USA, European Court) have ruled that consultation suffices and consent/veto is not required.

5. **Continued Approvals:** States continue approving major extractive and infrastructure projects despite sustained Indigenous opposition, demonstrating rejection of FPIC in practice.

6. **Treaty Body Resistance:** States have explicitly rejected recommendations from CERD, Human Rights Committee, and ILO bodies regarding FPIC obligations.

7. **Geographic Breadth:** Evidence spans 40+ countries across 6 continents, demonstrating lack of uniform practice.

8. **Temporal Consistency:** Pattern persists from 2007 (UNDRIP adoption) through 2025, showing sustained resistance rather than evolving acceptance.

### Legal Significance:

For FPIC to constitute customary international law, it must satisfy two elements:

**1. State Practice (usus):** Consistent and general practice of states
**2. Opinio Juris:** Belief that such practice is legally required

**This research demonstrates:**
- **Inconsistent practice:** States routinely approve projects without consent
- **Non-uniform practice:** Different approaches across jurisdictions
- **Absence of opinio juris:** Explicit state statements rejecting legal obligation
- **Persistent objection:** Sustained objections from significant number of states

**Conclusion:** The evidence compiled herein supports the position that **FPIC has not crystallized into binding customary international law** due to inconsistent and non-uniform state practice, combined with explicit rejection of legal obligation by numerous states.
