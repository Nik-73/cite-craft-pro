# Comprehensive Research: FPIC Has NOT Crystallized Into Customary International Law

## Executive Summary

This research compilation presents scholarly articles, academic papers, and legal commentary that argue or acknowledge that Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) has NOT crystallized into customary international law (CIL). The sources demonstrate ongoing scholarly debate about whether FPIC meets the two requirements for CIL: (1) state practice and (2) opinio juris.

**Key Finding:** The consensus among scholars is that while FPIC is an important emerging norm, **the right to full FPIC is not yet part of customary international law**. States have a minimum obligation to consult with indigenous peoples in good faith, but full FPIC (especially as a veto right) has not achieved CIL status.

## I. MAJOR ACADEMIC ARTICLES (Post-2007)

### 1. Tara Ward (2011)
**Citation:** Ward, Tara. "The Right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent: Indigenous Peoples' Participation Rights within International Law." *Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights*, Vol. 10, Issue 2 (2011).

**URL:** https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njihr/vol10/iss2/2/

**Key Argument:**
Ward's comprehensive article examines whether FPIC has achieved customary international law status and concludes it has not.

**Specific Quotes:**
- "Although it is clear that as of yet **the right to full FPIC is not part of customary international law**, there is a well-defined consensus that States at a minimum have an obligation to consult with indigenous peoples in good faith with regard to any projects found within their lands or which impact traditionally used resources."
- "The question of whether the right to FPIC is an existing customary international legal principle is **particularly contentious**, especially regarding whether this constitutes a full veto right for the affected peoples."
- The article examines "the gap that exists between the standards being developed and current State practice."

**Significance:** One of the most comprehensive legal analyses of FPIC's status in international law, directly addressing the state practice and opinio juris requirements.

### 2. Megan Davis (2012)
**Citation:** Davis, Megan. "To Bind or Not to Bind: The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Five Years On." *Australian International Law Journal*, Vol. 19 (2012), pp. 17-48.

**URL:** http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AUIntLawJl/2012/3.html

**Key Argument:**
Davis examines UNDRIP's status in international law five years after adoption, exploring the central question: "to bind or not to bind?"

**Specific Quotes:**
- The article addresses "the question of its status in international law: to bind or not to bind?"
- Davis notes that "the explicit reasoning for much of the discussion and debate in the literature turns on the question of its status in international law."
- Australia stated that "the UNDRIP is an aspirational declaration with political and moral force but **no legal force**."

**Significance:** Written by an Expert Member and Rapporteur of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, providing insider perspective on the binding/non-binding debate.

### 3. Mauro Barelli (2009)
**Citation:** Barelli, Mauro. "The Role of Soft Law in the International Legal System: The Case of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples." *International and Comparative Law Quarterly*, Vol. 58 (October 2009), pp. 957-983.

**SSRN:** https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1680939

**Key Argument:**
Barelli's foundational article examines UNDRIP as soft law and its potential (or lack thereof) to create legally binding obligations.

**Specific Quotes:**
- "Since the UNDRIP does not per se create legally binding obligations, **some doubts exist with regard to its legal significance and capacity to affect State behaviour**."
- The article addresses whether soft law declarations can generate "reasonable expectations of conforming behaviour" even without binding legal force.

**Significance:** One of the earliest and most influential scholarly analyses of UNDRIP's soft law status, cited extensively in subsequent scholarship.

---

### 4. Emily M. McCulloch (Public Land & Resources Law Review)
**Citation:** McCulloch, Emily M. Article on FPIC evolution and implementation challenges. *Public Land & Resources Law Review*, University of Montana Alexander Blewett III School of Law.

**URL:** https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1744&context=plrlr

**Key Argument:**
Examines the evolution of FPIC and its failure to help indigenous populations due to lack of hard law status.

**Specific Quotes:**
- "The mere fact that scholars still debate whether the FPIC is customary international law **shows that it is not yet hard law**."
- "The FPIC is slowly becoming crystallized into hard law, yet, there is still ambiguity about executing the principle among countries that have signed UNDRIP."
- The article discusses "The FPIC and the push toward hard law" and the distinction between "hard law vs. soft law principles."

**Significance:** Directly addresses the crystallization process and acknowledges FPIC has not yet achieved hard law status.

### 5. Alexandra Xanthaki (2009)
**Citation:** Xanthaki, Alexandra. "Indigenous Rights in International Law over the Last 10 Years and Future Developments." *Melbourne Journal of International Law*, Vol. 10, Issue 1 (2009), pp. 27-37.

**URL:** https://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MelbJIL/2009/3.html

**Key Argument:**
Xanthaki critiques claims that UNDRIP already reflects customary international law as "over-ambitious."

**Specific Quotes:**
- "The need to have UNDRIP's standards translated into national practice has pushed commentators to declare its content 'customary international law'. However, Xanthaki suggests that **claiming indigenous rights already constitute uniform state practice seems over-ambitious**, and such suggestions actually undermine the importance of the Declaration."
- "UNDRIP does not reflect customary international law in its entirety, since **there is an evident lack of opinio juris**, as demonstrated when Canada stated the Declaration is 'a non-legally binding document that does not reflect customary international law.'"

**Significance:** Written by a leading expert on indigenous rights who later became UN Special Rapporteur on Cultural Rights; directly addresses lack of opinio juris.

- Product of 30 international experts' six-year study of state practice and opinio juris
- Explicitly states UNDRIP as a whole is NOT customary international law
- Represents authoritative scholarly position from major international law organization

---

## IV. LEGAL COMMENTARIES ON ILO CONVENTION 169

### 11. ILO Convention 169: Consultation vs. Consent Analysis
**Multiple Sources:** Academic analyses of ILO Convention 169 and FPIC

**Key Arguments:**
- ILO Convention 169 (1989) requires **consultation**, not consent
- "Consent is only explicitly required in relation to relocation of indigenous communities under ILO Convention 169."
- "The UNDRIP contains the norm of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) while C169 uses different words, primarily relying on consultation language instead."
- "The goal of consultations should always be to reach agreement or consensus, but **this does not imply that indigenous peoples have veto powers**."

**Significance:**
- ILO Convention 169 is "the only legally binding instrument dealing explicitly with indigenous peoples' rights"
- Shows international treaty law makes distinction between consultation and consent
- Demonstrates lack of state practice accepting FPIC as legal obligation

**Sources:**
- Rombouts, S.J. "Consultation and consent norms under ILO convention no. 169 and the UN declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples compared." Tilburg University Research Portal.
- Various articles in *The International Journal of Human Rights* examining ILO 169.

- Newman, Dwight. "The Rule and Role of Law: The Duty to Consult, Aboriginal Communities, and the Canadian Natural Resource Sector." SSRN: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2517033

**Key Arguments:**
- Newman challenges "claims that [FPIC] is binding international law"
- He argues "there are serious problems" with claims that FPIC "represents a veto on development if there is opposition from Indigenous communities"
- "UNDRIP is important, it is not a treaty and is not binding"
- Governments need to "clearly enunciate the position that FPIC implies good processes but not total control of decisions by Indigenous communities"

**Significance:**
One of Canada's leading experts on Indigenous rights; provides critical analysis questioning FPIC's binding status.

---

### 13. Veto Power Debate - Recent Scholarship
**Citation:** Multiple sources on FPIC as veto power (2019-2025)

**Key Findings:**
- "Whether FPIC means merely a duty to have meaningful consultations or an absolute authority to veto certain actions **remains a hotly debated topic** among legal scholars and courts." (2025)
- Canadian Federal Court (2025): "FPIC does not amount to 'veto power'" but rather "requires a process that places a heightened emphasis on the need for a deep level of consultation"
- "The ILO's tendency to resort to a binary veto-no-veto conception of FPIC disconnects the requirement for FPIC from the rights which it serves to safeguard."

**Significance:**
Even recent jurisprudence (2024-2025) continues to reject FPIC as veto power, indicating no crystallization into hard law with that interpretation.

---

## VI. STATE OBJECTIONS TO UNDRIP

### 14. CANZUS States' Objections (2007-2016)
**Sources:** Multiple diplomatic statements and government positions

**Australia's Position:**
- "The UNDRIP is an **aspirational declaration with political and moral force but no legal force**"
- "The declaration places indigenous customary law in a superior position to national law"
- Expressed concerns about provisions "which would not be acceptable, such as customary corporal and capital punishments"

**Canada's Position:**
- "Canada stated that the Declaration is 'a **non-legally binding document that does not reflect customary international law**'"
- Had "significant concerns about provisions on free, prior and informed consent when used as a veto"

**United States Position:**
- Emphasized UNDRIP could not "be cited as evidence of the evolution of customary international law"

**New Zealand Position:**
- Similar concerns about UNDRIP's legal status and FPIC as veto

**Significance:**
- All four dissenting states explicitly rejected UNDRIP as source of customary international law
- Even after later endorsing UNDRIP (2010-2016), these states maintained it was non-binding
- Demonstrates lack of opinio juris among key states

**Citations:**
- "Settler–State Political Theory, 'CANZUS' and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples." *European Journal of International Law*, Vol. 26, No. 2 (2015), pp. 345-373.

---

## VII. WORLD BANK POLICY: CONSULTATION NOT CONSENT

### 15. World Bank OP 4.10 and Environmental/Social Framework
**Sources:** World Bank policy documents and academic critiques

**Key Points:**
- World Bank uses "**free, prior and informed consultation**" (FPICon) rather than consent
- "Critics have questioned for the term 'consultation' to be used as opposed to consent and state that to mean that IP cannot decline a project if they do not agree with it"
- 2016 Environmental and Social Framework finally incorporated FPIC but with limitations
- "For projects that affect indigenous peoples, the borrower must engage in free, prior and informed consultation ('FPICon') with indigenous peoples. The Bank 'will provide project financing only where [FPICon] results in broad community support'"

**Significance:**
- Major development institution explicitly rejects full FPIC in favor of consultation
- Demonstrates international practice distinguishing consultation from consent
- Shows gap between UNDRIP standards and institutional implementation

**Citations:**
- "Indigenous Peoples' Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) and the World Bank Safeguards: Between Norm Emergence and Concept Appropriation." ResearchGate (2020).
- World Bank Environmental and Social Standard 7 (2016)

### 16. Saramaka v. Suriname (2007) - Limited FPIC Requirement
**Citation:** Inter-American Court of Human Rights. *Case of the Saramaka People v. Suriname*. Judgment of November 28, 2007.

**URL:** https://www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/casos/articulos/seriec_172_ing.pdf

**Key Findings:**
While groundbreaking for indigenous rights, the Court's decision shows FPIC applies only in limited circumstances:

- FPIC required when "**large-scale** development or investment projects could affect the **integrity** of the Saramaka people's lands and natural resources"
- For other projects: only consultation required
- Shows FPIC is not a general requirement but context-specific

**Quotes:**
- "When large-scale development or investment projects could affect the integrity of the Saramaka people's lands and natural resources, the State has a duty not only to consult with the Saramakas, but also to obtain their free, prior, and informed consent"
- But for other impacts: consultation suffices

**Significance:**
- Even most progressive jurisprudence limits FPIC to specific circumstances
- Shows FPIC has not achieved status as general customary rule
- Binding only in Americas, not globally

---

## IX. ACADEMIC ARTICLES ON STATE PRACTICE GAPS

### 17. Harvard Law Review - "The Double Life of International Law" (2016)

---

### 18. International Journal on Minority and Group Rights - Legal Ambiguity
**Citation:** Papillon, Martin; Leclair, Geneviève; Leydet, Dominique. "Free, Prior and Informed Consent: Between Legal Ambiguity and Political Agency." *International Journal on Minority and Group Rights*, Vol. 27, Issue 2 (2020), pp. 223-246.

**URL:** https://brill.com/view/journals/ijgr/27/2/article-p223_223.xml

**Key Arguments:**
- "In the absence of legal clarity, Canadian federal and provincial authorities have adopted an **ambiguous position on FPIC**"
- "The implementation of FPIC remains contested, with legal interpretation and political translation by state institutions being inconsistent and highly contingent"
- There are "significant variations and disagreements about its meaning, scope and practical implications"

**Significance:**
Documents ongoing legal uncertainty and lack of consistent state practice even in pro-indigenous rights jurisdiction.

---

## X. COMPARATIVE ANALYSES OF STATE IMPLEMENTATION

### 19. Implementation Challenges Across Jurisdictions
**Multiple Sources:** Academic studies of FPIC implementation (2015-2024)

**Key Findings:**
- "Despite increasing and widespread endorsement in international policy and law, **FPIC remains contentious**, with governments voicing reluctance to confer 'veto' rights to indigenous peoples"
- "Indigenous rights are subject to much more variable enforcement than investor rights"
- "Even cases pursued in the Inter-American human rights system face delays"
- "Many signatory countries have adopted FPIC on paper, **there is no indication of widespread conformance or belief that FPIC is legally binding**"

**Significance:**
Widespread implementation gaps demonstrate lack of consistent state practice and opinio juris required for CIL.

---

## XI. SCHOLARLY ARTICLES ON CONSULTATION VS. CONSENT

### 20. Journal of Applied Philosophy (2020)
**Citation:** Townsend, Karen. "Consultation, Consent, and the Silencing of Indigenous Communities." *Journal of Applied Philosophy*, Vol. 37, Issue 5 (2020), pp. 638-654.

**URL:** https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/japp.12438

**Key Arguments:**
- Distinguishes "the right to consultation (which entitles affected communities to enter into dialogue with states or companies about proposed developments) and the right to free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) (which entitles Indigenous communities to give or withhold their consent)"
- "Consultation only requires nations to notify Indigenous communities of their actions; consent requires their active approval"

**Significance:**
Demonstrates conceptual and legal distinction between consultation (more accepted) and consent (less accepted).

---

### 21. Environmental Politics (2019)
**Citation:** "From consent to consultation: Indigenous rights and the new environmental constitutionalism." *Environmental Politics*, Taylor & Francis (2019).

---

## XII. INDIGENOUS SCHOLARS' PERSPECTIVES

### 22. Dalee Sambo Dorough - Emerging Status
**Various publications and statements**

**Key Points:**
- Dorough (Iñupiaq scholar, Chair of Inuit Circumpolar Council) characterizes FPIC as "sourced in the right of self-determination"
- Describes FPIC as "now a key right of Indigenous peoples in international law and jurisprudence" but emphasizes ongoing struggles for recognition
- Her work on Arctic governance shows limitations of indigenous participation rights even post-UNDRIP

**Significance:**
Even indigenous rights advocates acknowledge ongoing challenges to FPIC recognition and implementation.

---

### 23. James Anaya - Evolution of Position
**Citations:**
- Anaya, S. James & Wiessner, Siegfried. Various writings on UNDRIP and customary international law
- Anaya's UN Special Rapporteur reports (2008-2014)

**Key Evolution:**
- Early scholarship: more expansive claims about FPIC
- As UN Special Rapporteur: "his new analysis as Special Rapporteur now opts for the more limited conception of consultation"
- Position that "While the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples may not be legally binding per se, **in important parts**, it reaffirms customary international law" [emphasis added - only parts, not whole]

**Significance:**
Even leading indigenous rights advocate distinguishes between UNDRIP as whole (not CIL) and specific provisions (possibly CIL).

---

- Shows "states have historically followed a limited approach to FPIC"

---

## XIV. RECENT JURISPRUDENCE (2020-2025)

### 26. Canadian Federal Court - Kebaowek First Nation v. Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (2025)
**Key Holding:**
"FPIC does not amount to 'veto power'" but rather "requires a process that places a heightened emphasis on the need for a deep level of consultation and negotiations geared toward a mutually accepted arrangement"

---

## XVII. ANALYSIS OF CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW REQUIREMENTS

### Lack of Sufficient State Practice

**Evidence:**
1. Only 23 countries have ratified ILO Convention 169 (which requires only consultation, not consent)
2. CANZUS states explicitly rejected UNDRIP as reflecting CIL
3. World Bank and other institutions use consultation standards, not FPIC
4. Many UNDRIP endorsing states have not implemented FPIC domestically
5. "Many signatory countries have adopted FPIC on paper, there is no indication of widespread conformance"

### Lack of Opinio Juris (Belief of Legal Obligation)

**Evidence:**
1. States characterize UNDRIP as "aspirational," "soft law," "political and moral force"
2. Multiple states explicitly deny UNDRIP creates legal obligations
3. Legal ambiguity persists even in progressive jurisdictions
4. Courts continue to reject FPIC as veto power
5. Xanthaki notes "evident lack of opinio juris"

---

## XVIII. EMERGING VS. ESTABLISHED NORMS

### Sources Characterizing FPIC as "Emerging" (Not Yet Established):

1. **Cathal Doyle:** "FPIC constitutes an **emerging norm** of international law"

2. **Multiple Sources:** "At a minimum, the need to obtain FPIC can be regarded as an **emerging customary norm**, especially in certain cases such as resettlement"

3. **Emily McCulloch:** "The FPIC is **slowly becoming crystallized** into hard law"

4. **Various Scholars:** FPIC is "solidifying as a norm" - indicating ongoing process, not completed status

**Significance:** "Emerging norm" language indicates FPIC has NOT yet crystallized into binding CIL.

2. **Opinio juris is lacking** - states continue to characterize UNDRIP as non-binding, aspirational soft law

3. **State practice is insufficient** - widespread implementation gaps, preference for consultation over consent

4. **FPIC is "emerging" not "established"** - even advocates characterize it as developing norm

5. **Legal ambiguity persists** - ongoing scholarly debate, inconsistent jurisprudence, varied implementation

6. **Minimum consultation duty exists** - consensus that states must consult in good faith, but full FPIC with veto power is not required

7. **ILA study conclusion is authoritative** - 30 experts over 6 years concluded UNDRIP "as a whole cannot yet be considered customary international law"
