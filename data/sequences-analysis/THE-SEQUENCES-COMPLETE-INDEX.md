**Length:** ~1700 words

``rationality'' should be
consistent under
reflection---``rationally''
looking at the evidence, and
``rationally'' considering how your
mind processes the evidence, shouldn't lead to two
different conclusions.

**Themes:** Bayesian Reasoning, Rationality, Truth & Beliefs  
**Length:** ~800 words

impure---should we not desire the truth for its own sake.

> The third reason that I can think of is morality: You
believe that to seek the truth is noble and important and worthwhile.

#### Occam's Razor

**Themes:** Cognitive Biases, Bayesian Reasoning, Rationality  
**Length:** ~1400 words

**Notable excerpts:**

program to better ``fit'' one
possibility, it must steal probability mass from some other possibility

only about fit, then you will always prefer programs that
claim to deterministically predict the data, assign it 100\
probability.

#### Conservation of Expected Evidence

**Themes:** Bayesian Reasoning, Rationality, Truth & Beliefs  
**Length:** ~800 words

**Notable excerpts:**

> The rule that
``absence of evidence is evidence of
absence'' is a special case of a more general law,
which I would name Conservation of Expected Evidence: The
expectation of the posterior probability, after viewing the
evidence, must equal the prior probability.

> If you expect a strong probability of seeing weak evidence in one
direction, it must be balanced by a weak expectation of seeing strong
evidence in the other direction.

> If you're very
confident in your theory, and therefore anticipate seeing an outcome
that matches your hypothesis, this can only provide a very small
increment to your belief (it is already close to 1); but the unexpected
failure of your prediction would (and must) deal your confidence a huge
blow.

#### Go Forth and Create the Art!

**Themes:** Cognitive Biases, Rationality, Science & Epistemology  
**Length:** ~1500 words

**Notable excerpts:**

perhaps, a certain centralized website, where you went to post the
links and papers that struck you as really important.

> But
maybe I'm wrong, and the next leg of the work will be
done by direct, specific investigation of
``rationality,'' without any need of
a specific application considered more important.
