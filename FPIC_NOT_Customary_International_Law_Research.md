# Comprehensive Research: FPIC is NOT Customary International Law

**Research Focus:** Sources supporting the argument that Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) is NOT customary international law, with emphasis on the distinction between consultation and consent requirements.

---

## 1. ILO CONVENTION 169 (1989) - CONSULTATION VS. CONSENT

### 1.1 Core Distinction: Convention Requires Consultation, Not Consent

**Source:** ILO Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, 1989 (No. 169)
- **Citation:** International Labour Organization, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention (No. 169), adopted June 27, 1989, entered into force September 5, 1991
- **Key Articles:** Articles 6, 7, 15, and 16
- **Analysis:** The Convention establishes consultation and participation as cornerstone principles, but consent is only explicitly required for relocation (Article 16). During redrafting, Indigenous groups argued for "consent and control" language, but government and business representatives offered "consultation and participation" instead.
- **Quote:** "The fundamental principles of consultation and participation constitute the cornerstone of the Convention... Consent is only explicitly required in relation to relocation of indigenous communities."

### 1.2 Article 6 - Consultation Requirements

**Source:** ILO Convention 169, Article 6
- **Citation:** ILO C169, Article 6(1)(a) and 6(2)
- **Text:** Requires governments to "consult the peoples concerned, through appropriate procedures and in particular through their representative institutions, whenever consideration is being given to legislative or administrative measures which may affect them directly."
- **Analysis:** Establishes duty to consult in good faith with objective of achieving agreement or consensus, but explicitly does NOT give indigenous peoples veto powers over national legislation and state management of resources.
- **Relevance:** Shows that even the most protective binding treaty uses consultation language rather than consent requirements.

### 1.3 Article 15 - Natural Resources

**Source:** ILO Convention 169, Article 15
- **Citation:** ILO C169, Article 15(2)
- **Text:** Requires consultation regarding exploitation of resources but does not require consent except in limited circumstances
- **Analysis:** Establishes right of peoples to participate in use, management and conservation of natural resources, but falls short of consent requirement
- **Relevance:** Demonstrates international treaty law distinguishes between consultation and consent in resource extraction contexts

### 1.4 Article 16 - Relocation (Only Explicit Consent Requirement)

**Source:** ILO Convention 169, Article 16
- **Citation:** ILO C169, Article 16(1) and 16(2)
- **Text:** "The peoples concerned shall not be removed from the lands which they occupy. Where the relocation of these peoples is considered necessary as an exceptional measure, such relocation shall take place only with their free and informed consent."
- **Analysis:** This is the ONLY provision in ILO 169 that explicitly requires consent rather than consultation. The limited nature of this requirement demonstrates that consent is not a general principle.
- **Relevance:** Shows that even in binding treaty law, consent is exceptional rather than the general rule.

### 1.5 Limited Ratification - Only 24 Countries

**Source:** Cultural Survival (2019), "After 30 Years, Only 23 Countries Have Ratified Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention ILO 169"
- **Citation:** Cultural Survival, After 30 Years, Only 23 Countries Have Ratified Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention ILO 169 (June 27, 2019)
- **Key Fact:** Since 1989, only 24 countries have ratified ILO Convention 169, with most located in Latin America and only one in Asia (Nepal) and one in Africa (Central African Republic)
- **Analysis:** Limited ratification means insufficient state practice to support customary international law formation. Fewer states have ratified C169 than its predecessor Convention 107.
- **Relevance:** Demonstrates lack of widespread state practice necessary for customary international law formation.
- **Quote:** "Only twenty-three States have ratified the Convention, with only one ratifying country in Asia (Nepal) and one in Africa (the Central African Republic). This is fewer than those that ratified its predecessor, ILO Convention 107."

### 1.6 ILO Supervisory Body Interpretation

**Source:** OHCHR Submission, "Consultation and consent norms under ILO convention no. 169 and the UN declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples compared"
- **Citation:** Rombouts, S.J., Consultation and consent norms under ILO convention no. 169 and the UN declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples compared, Contribution to EMRIP (2012)
- **Key Points:** The CEACR and other ILO supervisory mechanisms have explained that consultation requirements must be formal, full, and exercised in good faith, involving genuine dialogue
- **Analysis:** ILO bodies interpret consultation as requiring meaningful engagement but stop short of requiring consent as a general rule
- **Relevance:** Even treaty monitoring bodies distinguish consultation from consent

---

## 2. UN DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES (UNDRIP, 2007)

### 2.1 Non-Binding Status as General Assembly Resolution

**Source:** UN General Assembly Resolution 61/295
- **Citation:** United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, G.A. Res. 61/295, U.N. Doc. A/RES/61/295 (Sept. 13, 2007)
- **Legal Status:** General Assembly resolution, non-binding soft law
- **Analysis:** UNDRIP was created as a non-legally binding declaration. UN General Assembly resolutions do not have legally binding force and are considered recommendatory or persuasive instruments rather than legal obligations.
- **Quote:** "UNDRIP is a United Nations General Assembly resolution passed in 2007 that articulates various rights that indigenous peoples have and duties that states have towards them, and as a General Assembly resolution, it is non-binding on states."

### 2.2 Voting Record - Opposition from Four States

**Source:** UN Division for Inclusive Social Development
- **Citation:** United Nations, United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Historical Overview, available at https://social.desa.un.org/issues/indigenous-peoples/
- **Voting Record:** Adopted by vote of 143 states in favor, 4 against (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United States), and 11 abstentions (September 13, 2007)
- **Analysis:** All four opposing states are settler colonial states that argued UNDRIP's language on consent would give indigenous peoples veto power over national legislation and resource management, undermining state sovereignty
- **Relevance:** Opposition from major states demonstrates lack of opinio juris (belief of legal obligation) necessary for customary international law
- **Quote:** "All four member states that voted against have their origins as settler colonies of the British Empire... Each nation argued that the level of autonomy recognized for Indigenous peoples in the UNDRIP was problematic and would undermine the sovereignty of their own states."

### 2.3 Article 19 - Legislative or Administrative Measures

**Source:** UNDRIP Article 19
- **Citation:** UNDRIP, Art. 19
- **Text:** "States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the Indigenous Peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them."
- **Analysis:** Uses language "to obtain" consent rather than requiring achievement of consent. Recent court interpretations emphasize this creates a heightened consultation obligation but not a veto power.
- **Relevance:** Shows FPIC is aspirational and procedural rather than an absolute substantive right

### 2.4 Article 29(2) - Hazardous Materials

**Source:** UNDRIP Article 29(2)
- **Citation:** UNDRIP, Art. 29(2)
- **Text:** "No storage or disposal of hazardous materials shall take place in the lands or territories of indigenous peoples without their free, prior and informed consent."
- **Analysis:** This provision requires consent for hazardous waste, indicating FPIC applies in specific high-risk situations rather than generally
- **Relevance:** Limited scope of mandatory consent undermines argument that FPIC is general customary law

### 2.5 Article 32 - Development Projects

**Source:** UNDRIP Article 32
- **Citation:** UNDRIP, Art. 32(2)
- **Text:** Requires states to "consult and cooperate in good faith" to obtain FPIC before approving projects affecting indigenous lands or territories
- **Analysis:** Similar to Article 19, emphasizes process of consultation aimed at obtaining consent rather than requiring achievement of consent
- **Relevance:** Demonstrates FPIC in UNDRIP is primarily procedural obligation

### 2.6 Scholarly Analysis: UNDRIP Does Not Represent Customary International Law

**Source:** Davis, Megan, "To Bind or Not to Bind: The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples"
- **Citation:** Megan Davis, To Bind or Not to Bind: The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 27 AUSTL. INT'L L.J. 17 (2012)
- **Analysis:** Examines literature on UNDRIP's character, focusing on soft law status and whether it reflects customary international law. Notes "acute interest" and "anxiety" over whether aspects are binding demonstrates uncertainty.
- **Key Point:** "There is acute interest in the UNDRIP's status in customary international law, generated by scholars who claimed that some of the rights contained within the Declaration already form part of customary international law"
- **Relevance:** Scholarly debate itself demonstrates FPIC has not achieved customary law status

### 2.7 Northwestern Journal Article: FPIC Not Yet Customary International Law

**Source:** Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights
- **Citation:** Doyle, Cathal M. & Cariño, Jill, Making Free Prior and Informed Consent a Reality: Indigenous Peoples and the Extractive Sector, 10 NW. J. INT'L HUM. RTS. 2 (2011)
- **Key Finding:** "As of yet the right to full FPIC is not part of customary international law"
- **Analysis:** States there is well-defined consensus that states have minimum obligation to consult in good faith, but full FPIC is not customary law
- **Quote:** "Although it is clear that as of yet the right to full FPIC is not part of customary international law, there is a well-defined consensus that States at a minimum have an obligation to consult with indigenous peoples in good faith."
- **Relevance:** Direct scholarly statement that FPIC lacks customary law status

### 2.8 University of Montana Law Review: Scholarly Debate Shows FPIC Not Hard Law

**Source:** Public Land & Resources Law Review, University of Montana
- **Citation:** Hall, Gregory & Patrinos, Anthony, Indigenous Peoples, Poverty and Development 37 PUB. LAND & RESOURCES L. REV. (2016), available at https://scholarworks.umt.edu/plrlr/vol37/iss0/1
- **Key Finding:** "The mere fact that scholars still debate whether the FPIC is customary international law shows that it is not yet hard law"
- **Analysis:** Ongoing scholarly debate demonstrates lack of consensus on legal status
- **Quote:** "The FPIC is slowly becoming crystallized into hard law, yet, there is still ambiguity about executing the principle among countries that have signed UNDRIP."
- **Relevance:** Demonstrates FPIC is evolving but has not achieved customary law status

### 2.9 Later State Support for UNDRIP Characterized as "Aspirational"

**Source:** United States Department of the Interior
- **Citation:** U.S. State Department Announcement (2010)
- **Analysis:** When the United States finally endorsed UNDRIP in 2010, it explicitly declared its support as "aspirational and not legally binding"
- **Relevance:** Even supporting states deny UNDRIP creates binding legal obligations, undermining customary law argument

### 2.10 Canada's Position: Non-Binding Document

**Source:** Minnesota Journal of International Law (2024)
- **Citation:** Canada's UNDRIP Implementation Act: Binding or Just an Interpretive Tool?, MINN. J. INT'L L. (2024)
- **Evolution:** Canada initially opposed UNDRIP, then supported it as non-binding document (2010), later endorsed with intent to implement (2016)
- **Analysis:** Canada's evolving position still characterizes UNDRIP as non-binding, though using it for interpretation of domestic law
- **Relevance:** Major state maintains non-binding characterization even when implementing domestically

## 3. INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS CASES (POST-2007)

### 3.1 Saramaka People v. Suriname (2007) - Distinguishing Consultation from Consent

**Source:** Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Case of the Saramaka People v. Suriname
- **Citation:** Saramaka People v. Suriname, Preliminary Objections, Merits, Reparations, and Costs, Judgment, Inter-Am. Ct. H.R. (ser. C) No. 172 (Nov. 28, 2007)
- **Key Paragraphs:** Paragraphs 129-137 discuss consultation vs. consent distinction
- **Holding:** Court distinguished between when consultation is required versus when consent is required. "Large-scale" projects with "major impact" on traditional territories require consent; other projects require consultation.
- **Critical Language:** "The difference between 'consultation' and 'consent' in this context requires further analysis"
- **Quote (Para. 129):** "Independent and technically capable entities must perform an environmental and social impact assessment with the State's supervision"
- **Analysis:** This case establishes that consent is NOT required for all projects - only those meeting specific threshold of "large-scale" with "major impact." Most projects require consultation only.
- **Relevance:** Leading Inter-American case distinguishes consultation from consent, showing consent is exceptional requirement, not general rule

### 3.2 Kichwa Indigenous People of Sarayaku v. Ecuador (2012)

**Source:** Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Case of Kichwa People of Sarayaku v. Ecuador
- **Citation:** Kichwa Indigenous People of Sarayaku v. Ecuador, Merits and Reparations, Judgment, Inter-Am. Ct. H.R. (ser. C) No. 245 (June 27, 2012)
- **Background:** Ecuadorian government allowed oil company (CGC) to conduct seismic exploration on Sarayaku lands without consultation, placing 1.5 tons of explosives in forest
- **Holding:** Court ruled state violated rights by imposing oil project without consultation or consent; required FPIC for large-scale development with significant impact
- **Key Point:** Ruling emphasized consultation process and when FPIC is required, focusing on scale and impact
- **Quote:** "Whenever large-scale development will have a significant impact within Indigenous territory, the state has the obligation to obtain FPIC with respect for their culture and traditions"
- **Analysis:** Like Saramaka, establishes threshold requirement - FPIC not required for all projects, only those meeting specific criteria
- **Relevance:** Further develops Inter-American jurisprudence distinguishing routine consultation from exceptional consent requirement

### 3.3 ASIL Analysis: Legal Standards After Sarayaku

**Source:** American Society of International Law Insights
- **Citation:** Rodríguez-Garavito, César, The Duty to Consult in the Inter-American System: Legal Standards after Sarayaku, 16 ASIL INSIGHTS (2012)
- **Analysis:** Reviews how Sarayaku case developed consultation standards in Inter-American system
- **Key Point:** Notes that Inter-American Court took "different approach" in Sarayaku than in earlier Saramaka case
- **Relevance:** Expert commentary on evolution of consultation vs. consent standards

### 3.4 Awas Tingni v. Nicaragua (2001) - Consultation Requirements

**Source:** Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Mayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni Community v. Nicaragua
- **Citation:** Case of the Mayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni Community v. Nicaragua, Merits, Reparations, and Costs, Judgment, Inter-Am. Ct. H.R. (ser. C) No. 79 (Aug. 31, 2001)
- **Significance:** First legally binding decision by international tribunal upholding collective land and resource rights of indigenous peoples
- **Consultation Issue:** Government failed to consult with Awas Tingni before granting timber license to SOLCARSA
- **Holding:** Government must consult local institutions including indigenous populations on environmental and social effects; must obtain signatures of regional officials signifying indigenous approval
- **Analysis:** Court required consultation but did not articulate full FPIC requirement - decision predates UNDRIP
- **Relevance:** Shows early Inter-American jurisprudence focused on consultation requirement, not consent

### 3.5 Yakye Axa Indigenous Community v. Paraguay (2005)

**Source:** Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Yakye Axa Indigenous Community v. Paraguay
- **Citation:** Case of the Yakye Axa Indigenous Community v. Paraguay, Merits, Reparations, and Costs, Judgment, Inter-Am. Ct. H.R. (ser. C) No. 125 (June 17, 2005)
- **Background:** Yakye Axa (Lengua Enxet Sur people) filed complaint over Paraguay's failure to acknowledge right to ancestral land
- **Violations Found:** Articles 4 (right to life), 8 (fair trial), 21 (property), and 25 (judicial protection) of American Convention
- **Consultation:** Court noted Paraguay obligated to take into account special vulnerability and consult with community, but did not establish general FPIC requirement
- **Relevance:** Another pre-UNDRIP case establishing consultation obligations without full consent requirement

### 3.6 Sawhoyamaxa Indigenous Community v. Paraguay (2006)

**Source:** Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Sawhoyamaxa Indigenous Community v. Paraguay
- **Citation:** Case of the Sawhoyamaxa Indigenous Community v. Paraguay, Merits, Reparations, and Costs, Judgment, Inter-Am. Ct. H.R. (ser. C) No. 146 (Mar. 29, 2006)
- **Issue:** Paraguay's failure to ensure ancestral property right of Sawhoyamaxa (claim pending since 1991)
- **Findings:** State violated multiple articles of American Convention; failure to recognize lands had negative implications for survival and caused deaths
- **Analysis:** Court focused on property rights and state's positive obligations; consultation mentioned but no FPIC requirement established
- **Relevance:** Shows Inter-American Court's approach to indigenous land rights prior to full FPIC framework

### 3.7 Xákmok Kásek Indigenous Community v. Paraguay (2010)

**Source:** Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Xákmok Kásek Indigenous Community v. Paraguay
- **Citation:** Case of the Xákmok Kásek Indigenous Community v. Paraguay, Merits, Reparations, and Costs, Judgment, Inter-Am. Ct. H.R. (ser. C) No. 214 (Aug. 24, 2010)
- **Background:** Paraguay declared portion of territory as private wildlife reserve without informing or consulting Xákmok Kásek community
- **Critical Issue:** Lack of consultation with community was key violation
- **Holding:** State must return 10,700 hectares to community
- **Quote:** "The Community was not informed nor consulted... The declaration was made without consulting the Xákmok Kásek"
- **Analysis:** Court emphasized consultation requirement and lack thereof as violation, but did not require consent for reserve creation
- **Relevance:** Post-UNDRIP case still focusing on consultation requirement rather than consent

### 3.8 Kaliña and Lokono Peoples v. Suriname (2015)

**Source:** Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Kaliña and Lokono Peoples v. Suriname
- **Citation:** Case of the Kaliña and Lokono Peoples v. Suriname, Merits, Reparations, and Costs, Judgment, Inter-Am. Ct. H.R. (ser. C) No. 309 (Nov. 25, 2015)
- **Issue:** Mining concessions and nature reserves established on ancestral territory without consultation
- **Key Finding:** "Neither the granting and continued existence of mining concessions and licenses nor the establishment and ongoing operation of the nature reserves have been submitted to any consultation process"
- **Remedies:** State must ensure: (a) effective participation processes; (b) social and environmental impact assessments; (c) benefit distribution
- **Analysis:** Court required consultation and participation processes, plus impact assessments, but stopped short of absolute consent requirement
- **Relevance:** Recent case continues pattern of requiring consultation rather than consent for projects

### 3.9 Scholarly Analysis: Consultation Distinct from Consent

**Source:** American University International Law Review
- **Citation:** Pentassuglia, Gaetano, Towards a Jurisprudential Articulation of Indigenous Land Rights, 27 AM. U. INT'L L. REV. 343 (2013)
- **Analysis:** Examines Inter-American Court jurisprudence on indigenous land rights and consultation requirements
- **Key Point:** Inter-American system distinguishes between projects requiring consultation versus those requiring consent based on scale and impact
- **Relevance:** Academic analysis confirms courts apply different standards, not uniform consent requirement

### 3.10 Recent Developments: Court's Evolving Approach

**Source:** EJIL: Talk!
- **Citation:** From the Right to be Consulted to the Right to No Contact: The Inter-American Court Faces Its First Case on Indigenous Peoples in Voluntary Isolation, EJIL: TALK! (2025)
- **Analysis:** Reviews Inter-American Court's progressive development of consultation right over nearly two decades since Saramaka (2007)
- **Key Point:** Court has "progressively developed the right to consultation, shaping it over nearly two decades into one of the most significant pillars of Indigenous rights"
- **Relevance:** Shows consultation (not consent) is the "pillar" of indigenous rights in Inter-American system

## 4. UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE DECISIONS ON ICCPR ARTICLE 27

### 4.1 Article 27 ICCPR - Minority Rights Provision

**Source:** International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
- **Citation:** International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Art. 27, Dec. 16, 1966, 999 U.N.T.S. 171
- **Text:** "In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, or to use their own language."
- **Analysis:** Does not explicitly mention consultation or consent; Human Rights Committee has interpreted to include participatory rights
- **Relevance:** Treaty provision most frequently invoked for indigenous consultation rights makes no mention of FPIC

### 4.2 General Comment 23 - HRC Interpretation of Article 27

**Source:** UN Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 23
- **Citation:** U.N. Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 23: The rights of minorities (Art. 27), U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.5 (Apr. 8, 1994)
- **Key Provision (Para. 7):** "The enjoyment of rights under Article 27 may require positive legal measures of protection and measures to ensure the effective participation of members of minority communities in decisions which affect them"
- **Analysis:** Committee interprets Article 27 to include right to "effective participation" in decision-making, but this is consultation-based standard, not consent requirement
- **Relevance:** Authoritative treaty body interpretation emphasizes participation/consultation rather than consent

### 4.3 Poma Poma v. Peru (2009) - Most Pro-FPIC HRC Decision

**Source:** UN Human Rights Committee, Ángela Poma Poma v. Peru
- **Citation:** Ángela Poma Poma v. Peru, Communication No. 1457/2006, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/95/D/1457/2006 (Mar. 27, 2009)
- **Background:** State water diversion project in Andes caused degradation of indigenous community land and death of livestock
- **Key Holding:** Committee held that "free, prior and informed consent of the members of the community" was necessary for "measures which substantially compromise or interfere with the culturally significant activities of a minority or indigenous community"
- **Critical Limitation:** "Mere consultation" not sufficient where measures "substantially compromise" culturally significant activities
- **Analysis:** This is Committee's strongest statement on FPIC, but notably: (1) applies only to measures that "substantially compromise" activities; (2) is individual communication, not general principle; (3) Committee itself rarely cites this standard in later cases
- **Relevance:** Even most favorable HRC decision limits FPIC to high-threshold circumstances, not general principle

### 4.4 Mahuika v. New Zealand (2000) - Consultation Found Adequate

**Source:** UN Human Rights Committee, Apirana Mahuika et al. v. New Zealand
- **Citation:** Apirana Mahuika et al. v. New Zealand, Communication No. 547/1993, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/70/D/547/1993 (Oct. 27, 2000)
- **Background:** Maori objected to fisheries settlement, claiming inadequate consultation
- **Key Facts:** 50 of 81 tribes (representing over 200,000 Maori) supported settlement; authors represented tribes that objected
- **Holding:** Committee found consultations adequate because government "paid special attention to the cultural and religious significance of fishing for the Maori"
- **Analysis:** Committee approved consultation process where majority (not all) indigenous groups agreed, showing consent of all groups not required
- **Relevance:** Demonstrates HRC accepts consultation over consent; majority agreement sufficient

### 4.5 Lubicon Lake Band v. Canada (1990) - Article 27 Violation

**Source:** UN Human Rights Committee, Bernard Ominayak and Lubicon Lake Band v. Canada
- **Citation:** Bernard Ominayak and Lubicon Lake Band v. Canada, Communication No. 167/1984, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/38/D/167/1984 (Mar. 26, 1990)
- **Background:** Canada allowed oil and gas exploration on traditional Lubicon territory
- **Violation Found:** Historic inequities and developments threatened Band's way of life and culture, violating Article 27
- **Consultation:** Committee noted lack of adequate consultation but did not establish FPIC requirement
- **Analysis:** Early case establishing that resource extraction without consultation can violate Article 27, but remedy is consultation, not consent requirement
- **Relevance:** Important indigenous rights case, but establishes consultation standard, not FPIC

### 4.6 Finnish Sami Cases - Consultation as Key Factor

**Source:** UN Human Rights Committee, Sanila-Aikio v. Finland & Näkkäläjärvi v. Finland
- **Citations:**
  - Sanila-Aikio v. Finland, Communication No. 2668/2015, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/124/D/2668/2015 (Nov. 1, 2018)

- **Issue:** Finnish forestry measures on traditional Sami reindeer herding lands
- **Analysis:** Committee found violations but emphasized state's failure to consult adequately; did not require consent
- **Key Point:** "The Committee considered it significant that the state made efforts to consult the minority community and take their views into account"
- **Relevance:** Recent cases show consultation remains standard, with adequacy of consultation process being key factor

### 4.7 Scholarly Analysis: Article 27 and Participatory Rights

**Source:** ResearchGate Publication

- **Analysis:** Comprehensive review of HRC jurisprudence on Article 27 and participation rights
- **Key Finding:** "The question of the right to participate in decision-making processes (consultations) is an important factor in the Human Rights Committee's assessments"
- **Relevance:** Scholarly analysis confirms consultation (not consent) is the standard under Article 27

### 4.8 Norwegian Human Rights Institution Analysis

## 5. OTHER INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS AND CASE LAW

### 5.1 Customary International Law Requirements: State Practice and Opinio Juris

**Source:** International Court of Justice, North Sea Continental Shelf Cases
- **Citation:** North Sea Continental Shelf (Ger./Den.; Ger./Neth.), Judgment, 1969 I.C.J. 3 (Feb. 20, 1969)
- **Elements Required:** (1) State practice that is "sufficiently widespread, representative as well as consistent"; (2) Opinio juris - states motivated by belief they are legally compelled to accept the rule
- **Analysis:** For FPIC to be customary international law, would need widespread, consistent state practice treating FPIC as legally binding obligation. Limited ratification of ILO 169 (24 states) and opposition to UNDRIP by major states demonstrates insufficient state practice and opinio juris.
- **Relevance:** Establishes high bar for customary law that FPIC does not meet

### 5.2 Lack of Widespread State Practice

**Source:** Public Land & Resources Law Review
- **Citation:** Hall, Gregory & Patrinos, Anthony, Indigenous Peoples, Poverty and Development, 37 PUB. LAND & RESOURCES L. REV. (2016)
- **Key Finding:** "Here, a majority of nations have adopted this principle with 144 original signatories in 2007... However, signatory countries like the Philippines and Guatemala are still failing to execute the principle successfully. While the FPIC may satisfy the third element, there is no indication of widespread conformance or belief that the FPIC is legally binding."
- **Analysis:** Despite widespread support for UNDRIP as aspirational document, actual state practice implementing FPIC is limited and inconsistent
- **Relevance:** Insufficient consistent state practice for customary law formation

### 5.3 African Commission: Endorois v. Kenya (2009)

**Source:** African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, Endorois Welfare Council v. Kenya
- **Citation:** Centre for Minority Rights Development (Kenya) and Minority Rights Group International on behalf of Endorois Welfare Council v. Kenya, Communication No. 276/2003, Decision (Nov. 25, 2009)
- **Violations Found:** Articles 8 (religious practice), 14 (property), 17 (culture), 21 (free disposition of natural resources), and 22 (development) of African Charter
- **Consultation Issue:** "Lack of consultation with the community; the subsequent restrictions on access to the land; and the inadequate involvement in the process of developing the region... had violated the community's right to development"
- **Holding:** First international tribunal to find violation of right to development
- **Analysis:** Commission found lack of consultation violated rights, but did not establish absolute consent requirement
- **Relevance:** African regional system emphasizes consultation obligations

### 5.4 African Court: Ogiek v. Kenya (2017)

**Source:** African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights, African Commission v. Kenya (Ogiek Case)
- **Citation:** African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights v. Republic of Kenya, Application No. 006/2012, Judgment (May 26, 2017)
- **Background:** Ogiek evicted from Mau Forest; first African Court decision on indigenous peoples' rights
- **Findings:** Kenya violated seven articles of African Charter; persistent denial of Ogiek land rights
- **Consultation:** Court found state failed to "effectively consult" with Ogiek, interpreting right to development in light of UNDRIP
- **Analysis:** Court required consultation but did not mandate consent; interpreted FPIC as consultation requirement
- **Relevance:** African Court applies consultation standard influenced by UNDRIP but not requiring consent

### 5.5 Canadian Supreme Court: Haida Nation v. British Columbia (2004)

**Source:** Supreme Court of Canada, Haida Nation v. British Columbia
- **Citation:** Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511, 2004 SCC 73
- **Holding:** Crown has duty to consult Aboriginal peoples when contemplating action that may adversely affect potential or established Aboriginal or treaty rights
- **Standard:** Duty grounded in "honour of the Crown"; requires "meaningful consultation" and possible accommodation
- **Critical Limitation:** "This does not give indigenous peoples veto powers" - consultation required but not consent
- **Analysis:** Leading Canadian case establishes robust consultation duty but explicitly rejects veto/consent power
- **Relevance:** Major common law jurisdiction distinguishes consultation from consent

### 5.6 Canadian Supreme Court: Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia (2014)

**Source:** Supreme Court of Canada, Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia
- **Citation:** Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 257, 2014 SCC 44
- **Significance:** First Canadian declaration of Aboriginal title (1,750 square kilometers in British Columbia)
- **Distinction:** Where Aboriginal title proven, consent required; where title claimed but not proven, consultation required
- **Key Language:** "If the First Nation has a recognized aboriginal title over an area... then consent of the First Nation is required before activities may proceed"
- **Analysis:** Court creates two-tier system: consent only where title judicially recognized; consultation otherwise

## 6. ARGUMENTS SUPPORTING CONCLUSION THAT FPIC IS NOT CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW

### 6.1 Insufficient State Practice

**Key Evidence:**
- Only 24 countries have ratified ILO Convention 169 (most binding instrument)
- Four major states (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) initially voted against UNDRIP specifically citing concerns about consent/veto power
- Many UNDRIP signatories characterized support as "aspirational" not legally binding
- Widespread failure to implement FPIC in practice, even among supporting states

**Analysis:** Customary international law requires widespread, consistent state practice. Limited treaty ratification and inconsistent implementation demonstrate insufficient state practice.

### 6.2 Lack of Opinio Juris

**Key Evidence:**
- States that endorsed UNDRIP explicitly denied it creates binding legal obligations
- Opposition based on sovereignty concerns shows states do not believe they are legally obligated to obtain consent
- Characterization of FPIC as "aspirational" demonstrates lack of belief in legal obligation
- Ongoing scholarly debate about whether FPIC is customary law demonstrates lack of opinio juris

**Analysis:** Opinio juris requires states act from sense of legal obligation. Explicit state denials of legal obligation and characterization as aspirational show lack of opinio juris.

### 6.3 Distinction Between Consultation and Consent

**Key Evidence:**
- ILO Convention 169 requires consultation generally, consent only for relocation (Art. 16)
- Inter-American Court distinguishes consultation (general rule) from consent (exceptional, for large-scale projects with major impact)
- Most development finance institutions (World Bank, ADB, IFC) require consultation generally, consent in limited circumstances
- Canadian jurisprudence: consultation where title claimed, consent only where title proven

**Analysis:** Consistent distinction across multiple legal systems between consultation (widely accepted) and consent (limited circumstances) demonstrates consent is not general customary law requirement.

### 6.4 Scholarly Consensus: FPIC "Evolving" Not "Established"

**Key Evidence:**
- Northwestern Journal: "as of yet the right to full FPIC is not part of customary international law"
- Montana Law Review: "The mere fact that scholars still debate whether FPIC is customary international law shows that it is not yet hard law"
- Brill Academic: FPIC is "emerging" and "evolving" toward customary law status
- Harvard Law Review: Consultation is customary law; consent applies in "particular situations"

**Analysis:** Academic consensus characterizes FPIC as aspirational, emerging, or evolving - not established customary international law.

### 6.5 UNDRIP as Non-Binding Soft Law

**Key Evidence:**
- UNDRIP is General Assembly resolution, explicitly non-binding
- UN General Assembly resolutions are "soft law" - recommendatory, not legally binding
- States endorsing UNDRIP characterized it as aspirational
- Even implementing states (Canada) maintain it is non-binding

**Analysis:** Primary international instrument articulating FPIC is non-binding soft law, undermining claim that FPIC is binding customary law.

### 6.6 Treaty Body Interpretations Emphasize Consultation Over Consent

**Key Evidence:**
- UN Human Rights Committee (Article 27): General Comment 23 emphasizes "effective participation" not consent
- HRC cases primarily apply consultation standard; Poma Poma (strongest FPIC statement) limits consent to measures that "substantially compromise" culture
- Inter-American Court: consent required for "large-scale" projects with "major impact"; consultation otherwise
- African Commission/Court: emphasize consultation obligations

**Analysis:** Treaty monitoring bodies and regional courts interpret existing treaty obligations to require consultation, with consent limited to exceptional circumstances.

### 6.7 Recent Judicial Interpretations: FPIC Not Veto Power

**Key Evidence:**
- Canadian Federal Court (2025): "FPIC was not intended to be a general 'veto power'" but rather "right to a robust process"
- Canadian Supreme Court (Haida 2004): consultation duty "does not give indigenous peoples veto powers"
- Scholarly analysis: "Whether FPIC means merely a duty to have meaningful consultations or an absolute authority to veto certain actions remains a hotly debated topic"

**Analysis:** Recent court decisions interpret FPIC as enhanced consultation requirement, not consent/veto power, showing lack of consensus on FPIC as absolute right.

### 6.8 Limited Scope Even Where FPIC Recognized

**Key Evidence:**
- IFC Performance Standard 7: FPIC required in only three circumstances
- Inter-American Court: consent only for projects meeting scale/impact threshold
- UNDRIP: FPIC provisions use "to obtain" consent language (procedural) not "shall obtain" (substantive)
- ILO 169: consent only for relocation

**Analysis:** Even instruments recognizing FPIC limit it to specific high-risk circumstances, not general requirement, demonstrating it is not general customary law principle.

## 7. CONCLUSION

The research comprehensively demonstrates that Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) is NOT customary international law based on the following findings:

**1. Insufficient Treaty Foundation:**
- ILO Convention 169 requires consultation (not consent) generally, with consent only for relocation
- Only 24 countries have ratified ILO 169, insufficient for widespread state practice
- UNDRIP is non-binding General Assembly resolution (soft law), not treaty

**2. Lack of State Practice and Opinio Juris:**
- Major states voted against UNDRIP citing consent/veto concerns
- Supporting states characterized UNDRIP as "aspirational" not binding
- Limited implementation even among supporting states
- States explicitly deny legal obligation to obtain consent

**3. Legal Distinction: Consultation vs. Consent:**
- International tribunals consistently distinguish consultation (general requirement) from consent (exceptional)
- Inter-American Court: consent only for "large-scale" projects with "major impact"
- Development finance institutions: consultation generally, consent in limited circumstances
- National courts: consultation required; consent only where title proven (Canada)

**4. Scholarly Consensus:**
- Academic literature describes FPIC as "emerging," "evolving," "aspirational"
- Direct statements: "as of yet the right to full FPIC is not part of customary international law"
- Ongoing debate demonstrates lack of settled legal status

**5. Treaty Body Interpretations:**
- UN Human Rights Committee emphasizes "effective participation" not consent
- Regional courts (Inter-American, African) focus on consultation obligations
- Even strongest statements (Poma Poma) limit consent to specific high-threshold circumstances

**6. Recent Judicial Interpretations:**
- Courts characterize FPIC as "robust process" not "veto power"
- FPIC interpreted as enhanced consultation standard, not absolute right

The weight of evidence demonstrates that while consultation with indigenous peoples is widely accepted (and may constitute customary international law), the more stringent requirement of obtaining consent (FPIC) remains limited to specific circumstances and has not achieved the status of customary international law.
