## ABSTRACT

This article provides empirical evidence that certain English legal concepts are structurally untranslatable into Indian regional languages, creating permanent derivative reasoning dependency that prevents indigenous legal development. Through systematic analysis of 80 district court judgments across Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Bengali examining 'consent' and 'dishonest intention', the article demonstrates three critical findings: zero instances of direct lexical equivalents, 270 per cent semantic density requiring triple the words for explanation, and zero instances of original legal reasoning independent of English precedents. These findings challenge the assumption that translation enables genuine multilingual legal access. The article argues that conceptual incommensurability between liberal individualist legal concepts and collectivist cultural frameworks creates not merely translation difficulty, but fundamental structural barriers to legal reasoning in regional languages. The implications extend beyond linguistics to access to justice, democratic legitimacy, and the constitutional promise of multilingual legal systems. The article concludes that India faces a stark choice: invest in genuine indigenous legal development over 50 years, acknowledge English-only reality with robust interpretation services, or continue the current system of false accessibility that this research demonstrates does not work.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Can law exist meaningfully in multiple languages when legal reasoning itself is linguistically bound to one language? This article examines this question through empirical analysis of Indian district court judgments, revealing that 165 years after the Indian Penal Code (1860), Indian regional languages still cannot express core legal concepts independently.[1] This is not a failure of the languages themselves, but a structural feature of legal transplantation without institutional support for indigenous legal development.

The Indian Constitution guarantees the right to legal proceedings in regional languages.[2] District courts increasingly issue judgments in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, and other regional languages. The Official Languages Act 1963 established Hindi as an official language, and recent reforms including the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 promise greater linguistic accessibility.[3] Yet this article demonstrates through systematic empirical analysis that these procedural accommodations mask a deeper problem: regional languages cannot generate independent legal doctrine on English-derived concepts.

The central argument of this article is that certain English legal concepts are structurally untranslatable into Indian regional languages due to conceptual incommensurability, creating permanent derivative reasoning dependency. This claim challenges three prevailing assumptions. First, that translation difficulty can be solved with better dictionaries or legal terminology development. Second, that judicial training in regional languages will enable independent doctrinal development. Third, that time will naturally close the linguistic gap as regional legal traditions mature. The empirical evidence presented here refutes all three assumptions.

### 1.1 Contemporary Relevance

This research addresses an urgent problem in Indian constitutional law and access to justice. Recent Supreme Court directives encourage regional language use in lower courts.[4] The Law Commission of India has recommended expanding regional language legal education.[5] Parliamentary debates invoke the constitutional promise of multilingual governance.[6] Yet if this article's thesis is correct, these reforms rest on a false premise: that translation enables genuine legal reasoning in regional languages.

The implications are profound. Over 80 per cent of Indians do not speak English fluently.[7] If legal concepts remain cognitively accessible only in English, the Indian legal system operates as a de facto English-only system despite constitutional guarantees of linguistic equality. This raises fundamental questions of democratic legitimacy: can citizens be governed by laws they cannot think about in their own languages?

### 1.2 Theoretical Framework

This article draws on three theoretical traditions. First, legal transplant theory, which examines how legal concepts transfer across jurisdictions and the conditions for successful adaptation.[8] Second, linguistic relativity theory, which suggests that language shapes thought and certain concepts may be inexpressible across linguistic-cultural boundaries.[9] Third, postcolonial legal theory, which analyses how colonial legal systems persist after formal independence through linguistic and conceptual dominance.[10]

The article contributes empirical evidence to these theoretical debates. Rather than philosophical speculation about translatability, it provides systematic data on how Indian courts actually translate and reason about legal concepts across languages. The findings support the strong incommensurability thesis: some concepts are not merely difficult to translate, but structurally incompatible with the target language's semantic and cultural framework.

### 1.3 Roadmap

Part 2 describes the research methodology, including corpus selection, analytical framework, and coding protocol. Part 3 presents the empirical findings across four tiers: lexical gaps, structural difficulty, reasoning dependency, and witness testimony transformations. Part 4 analyses the theoretical implications, distinguishing this structural untranslatability from mere translation difficulty. Part 5 examines policy implications and evaluates three options for Indian multilingual legal systems. Part 6 concludes by returning to the central question: whether law can genuinely exist in multiple languages when one language dominates legal reasoning.

## 2. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

### 2.1 Corpus Selection

The research analysed 80 Indian district court judgments from 2015 to 2024.[11] The corpus comprised 45 judgments on 'consent' under section 375 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 (sexual offences) and 35 judgments on 'dishonest intention' under sections 24, 378, 405, 415, and 420 (property crimes).[12]

Four languages were studied: Hindi (30 judgments), Tamil (20 judgments), Telugu (15 judgments), and Bengali (15 judgments). This selection captures both Indo-Aryan languages (Hindi, Bengali) and Dravidian languages (Tamil, Telugu), enabling analysis of whether linguistic family affects translatability.[13]

District courts were selected rather than High Courts or the Supreme Court for three reasons. First, district courts are more likely to use regional languages than appellate courts. Second, district courts represent the level where law meets ordinary citizens. Third, district court judges receive regional language witness testimony and must translate between colloquial usage and legal doctrine, making semantic gaps more visible.[14]

### 2.2 Concept Selection

'Consent' and 'dishonest intention' were selected to test different types of semantic gaps. 'Consent' tests philosophical incommensurability between liberal individualist autonomy and collectivist cultural frameworks.[15] The English legal concept of consent assumes autonomous individual choice, bodily sovereignty, and capacity for voluntary decision-making. These assumptions may be incompatible with cultural frameworks emphasising family honour, social duty, and relational selfhood.[16]

'Dishonest intention' tests definitional precision and temporal markers. Section 24 of the Indian Penal Code defines 'dishonestly' circularly as intending wrongful gain or loss.[17] This creates translation difficulties around mental state terms, moral versus legal distinctions, and temporal precision ('at the moment of taking').[18]

By selecting concepts with different gap types, the research tests whether structural untranslatability is concept-specific or systemic. If both concepts show similar patterns despite different semantic challenges, this supports the systemic thesis.[19]

### 2.3 Analytical Framework

Each judgment was coded along six dimensions. First, lexical analysis mapped terminology translations and classified them into six types: (1) direct equivalent, (2) approximate equivalent, (3) compound translation, (4) explanatory phrase, (5) untranslated English, and (6) neologism.[20]

Second, semantic structure analysis measured semantic density: how many regional language words were required to explain concepts expressed in English statutory language.[21] Third, witness testimony analysis tracked transformations from colloquial language to legal categorisation.[22]

Fourth, legal reasoning analysis classified judgments as derivative (applying English precedent), hybrid (English framework with regional cultural context), or original (independent reasoning in regional language).[23] Fifth, structural difficulty scoring quantified markers of translation difficulty including repetition, elaboration, hedging, code-switching to English, and meta-commentary on language.[24]

Sixth, cross-reference analysis documented which English cases were cited and whether any indigenous legal sources (dharma texts, regional scholarship) were referenced.[25] This comprehensive framework enables both quantitative measurement and qualitative assessment of semantic gaps.

## 3. EMPIRICAL FINDINGS: FOUR TIERS OF EVIDENCE

### 3.1 Tier 1: Lexical Evidence

The most striking finding is that across all 80 judgments, there were zero instances of Type 1 direct equivalents for either 'consent' or 'dishonest intention'.[26] No single regional language word captures these English legal concepts with equivalent semantic boundaries and doctrinal content.

Instead, Type 3 compound translations dominated at 48.75 per cent combined average, with Type 2 approximate equivalents at 30.5 per cent.[27] For 'consent', Hindi courts used five different terms with overlapping frequency totalling 130 per cent: sahmati (agreement/harmony, 60 per cent), razi hona (willing, 25 per cent), ichchha (wish, 15 per cent), anumati (permission, 10 per cent), and marzi (desire, 20 per cent).[28] The overlap indicates courts use multiple terms within the same judgment, demonstrating semantic instability.

For 'dishonest intention', Hindi courts used seven different terms totalling 123 per cent overlap: beimani ka irada (dishonest intention, 40 per cent), kapatpurna irada (deceitful intention, 25 per cent), dhokhadhari ka irada (fraudulent intention, 20 per cent), anyaypurna labh ka ashay (wrongful gain intention, 15 per cent), buri niyat (bad intent, 10 per cent), chhal-kapat ka irada (trickery intention, 8 per cent), and thagi ka man (cheating mind, 5 per cent).[29]

If stable translation existed, one term would dominate with 90 per cent or higher usage. The proliferation of competing terms with none achieving dominance indicates fundamental lexical instability. This pattern held across all four languages studied, suggesting it is a structural feature rather than language-specific problem.[30]

### 3.2 Tier 2: Structural Difficulty

Regional languages required 274 per cent more words on average to explain the same concepts expressed in English statutory language.[31] For 'consent', the English statute uses 37 words while regional language judicial definitions averaged 102.5 words (277 per cent density ratio). For 'dishonest intention', 28 English statutory words required an average 75.75 regional language words (271 per cent density ratio).[32]

This is not mere verbosity. Semantic density analysis shows courts struggle to express concepts concisely because no equivalent conceptual structure exists in regional languages. Courts must elaborate, provide multiple approximations, and use compound phrases to approach the English meaning.[33]

Structural difficulty scores averaged 47.75 for 'consent' and 39.75 for 'dishonest intention' on a 100-point scale, both in the 'high difficulty' range (41 to 60).[34] Code-switching to untranslated English terms occurred in 78 per cent of consent judgments and 65 per cent of dishonest intention judgments.[35] The most commonly untranslated phrases were 'free and voluntary consent' (92 per cent untranslated), 'mens rea' (88 per cent), 'actus reus' (85 per cent), and 'informed consent' (95 per cent).[36]

When courts retain English terms untranslated, they signal that regional languages cannot convey precise legal meaning. If courts themselves do not trust regional language precision, how can ordinary citizens access law in those languages?[37]

### 3.3 Tier 3: Reasoning Dependency

The most theoretically significant finding is that across all 80 judgments, there were zero instances of original legal reasoning independent of English precedents.[38] Legal reasoning was classified as 84 per cent derivative on average, applying English precedent and translating reasoning, with 16 per cent hybrid (English framework with regional cultural context) and zero per cent original.[39]

Every judgment followed the same pattern: cite English Supreme Court case, quote the ratio decidendi in English (often untranslated), then attempt regional language explanation derivative from the English quote.[40] The most cited cases were State of Punjab v Gurmit Singh for consent (cited in 67 per cent of judgments) and Emperor v Chimanlal for dishonest intention (cited in 58 per cent of judgments).[41]

Critically, there were no citations of Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, or Bengali legal scholarship, no references to indigenous legal philosophy from dharma or nyaya texts, and no linguistic analysis of the regional terms being used.[42] Legal doctrine exists only in English. Regional languages function as a reporting medium, not a reasoning medium.[43]

This finding has profound implications. If regional languages cannot generate independent legal reasoning after 165 years since the Indian Penal Code was enacted, when will they be able to do so? The data suggests this is not a temporary lag awaiting maturation, but a permanent structural constraint.[44]

### 3.4 Tier 4: Witness Testimony Transformations

Victims and witnesses never use the legal terminology courts impose.[45] In consent cases, victims testify using phrases like 'maine mana kiya' (I refused), 'main nahin chahti thi' (I did not want), and 'usne zabardasti ki' (he forced). Courts then categorise this testimony under the legal framework 'pidita ne sahmati nahin di' (victim did not give consent).[46] The term 'sahmati' never appears in victim testimony.

Similarly, in dishonest intention cases, victims describe being deceived ('dhokha diya'), robbed ('loot liya'), or conned ('thag liya'). Courts translate this into 'aropi ne beimani ke irade se' (accused with dishonest intention).[47] The legal phrase 'beimani ka irada' is absent from colloquial testimony.

This creates a cognitive gap. Courts add legal concepts absent from testimony (free consent, voluntary consent, wrongful gain, intention at time of taking) while losing experiential details victims provide (emotional complexity, active resistance, moral outrage).[48] The legal framework is imposed onto testimony rather than derived from it.

Most significantly, consent cases reveal cultural semantic interference. Victims focus on honour (izzat) rather than autonomy: 'meri izzat loot li gayi' (my honour was looted), 'ghar walon ko kya jawab dungi' (what answer will I give to family).[49] Harm is conceptualised as collective dishonour, not individual rights violation. Courts must apply an autonomy framework (English law) to honour testimony (Hindi cultural framework). These concepts are incommensurable.[50]

## 4. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS: STRUCTURAL UNTRANSLATABILITY

### 4.1 Three Levels of Untranslatability

The evidence demonstrates untranslatability at three levels. Level 1 is lexical: no single-word equivalents exist. This could potentially be solved through neologism or borrowing. Level 2 is conceptual: semantic structures are incompatible, requiring 270 per cent more words because concepts do not fit regional language frameworks. Level 3 is reasoning: inability to generate independent legal doctrine, creating permanent derivative dependency.[51]

Previous scholarship has focused on Level 1 lexical gaps, assuming better legal dictionaries or terminology standardisation would solve translation problems.[52] This article demonstrates the problem lies at Levels 2 and 3. Even if Level 1 lexical gaps were filled through neologism, conceptual incompatibility and reasoning dependency would persist.[53]

The distinction matters for policy. Level 1 problems can be solved within existing institutional structures through legal terminology commissions. Level 3 problems require fundamental reimagining of legal education, judicial training, appellate structure, and scholarly infrastructure over 50 years or more.[54]

### 4.2 Why Legal Transplant Failed Linguistically

The Indian Penal Code was drafted in English in 1860.[55] The Constitution of India 1950 guaranteed regional language use in courts.[56] The Official Languages Act 1963 established Hindi as an official language.[57] The Indian Penal Code was translated to Hindi in 1976, 116 years after the original.[58] The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 provides a new Hindi criminal code.[59]

Yet despite these reforms, legal education remains English-medium, the Supreme Court operates in English, legal scholarship is published in English, and bar examinations are English-based.[60] Regional languages have had no institutional infrastructure for independent legal development. They remain frozen in translation mode for 165 years.[61]

Successful multilingual legal systems like Canada and Switzerland developed multiple legal traditions independently before they merged.[62] French and English legal reasoning in Canada coexist because both developed indigenous doctrine. India has only one legal tradition (English) being translated into multiple languages without institutional support for those languages to develop independent doctrine.[63]

### 4.3 Philosophical Incommensurability

'Consent' demonstrates philosophical incommensurability particularly clearly. The English legal concept assumes liberal individualist autonomy: persons are bounded, separate individuals with sovereign control over their bodies and capacity for voluntary choice free from external constraint.[64] This philosophical framework may be incompatible with cultural contexts emphasising relational selfhood, family honour, social duty, and collective reputation.[65]

When victims testify about honour rather than autonomy, they are not merely using different words for the same concept. They are articulating a fundamentally different conceptualisation of harm, personhood, and social meaning.[66] Courts must translate honour testimony into autonomy doctrine because English law provides the doctrinal framework. But this translation loses the cultural meaning victims express.[67]

This is conceptual incommensurability in the strong sense: not difficulty translating between equivalent concepts, but impossibility of translation because the underlying philosophical frameworks are incompatible.[68] No amount of better dictionaries will solve this problem because the issue is not lexical but metaphysical.[69]

## 5. POLICY IMPLICATIONS

### 5.1 Three Options

The Indian multilingual legal system faces three options. Option A is an honest English-only system. Law already operates in English at the conceptual level; making it official would eliminate translation overhead and acknowledge linguistic reality.[70] However, this would exclude 80 per cent of the population, violate constitutional language rights, and be politically impossible.[71]

Option B is maintaining the current translation system. This is politically acceptable and requires no major structural changes. But this article demonstrates it does not work. It creates an illusion of access without substance, perpetuates derivative reasoning, and prevents indigenous legal development.[72]

Option C is genuine multilingual legal development. This requires Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Bengali medium law schools, regional language legal journals, bar examinations in regional languages, research into dharma and nyaya concepts as legal frameworks, indigenous legal vocabulary development, and regional High Courts functioning as independent doctrine generators.[73] The timeline would be 50 years minimum at massive cost with uncertain feasibility given philosophical incommensurability may be insurmountable.[74]

### 5.2 Access to Justice Implications

The standard assumption is that translation solves access to justice: conduct proceedings in regional languages, translate statutes, issue judgments in regional languages, and access is achieved.[75] This research shows translation is one-way (English to regional) while regional languages cannot reason back to generate doctrine. Legal concepts remain cognitively English even when expressed in regional words.[76]

Victims must translate their experiences into legal categories foreign to their cultural framework. This is cognitive colonisation, not access.[77] The question is whether people can meaningfully access law that operates in a conceptual framework foreign to their language and culture.[78] This research suggests the answer is no. If legal reasoning cannot happen in regional languages, access is a procedural illusion, not substantive reality.[79]

## 6. CONCLUSION

This article has demonstrated through systematic empirical analysis that certain English legal concepts are structurally untranslatable into Indian regional languages. Across 80 judgments, the evidence showed zero direct lexical equivalents, 270 per cent semantic density, zero original reasoning, and 84 per cent derivative dependency. These findings prove the central thesis: conceptual incommensurability creates permanent derivative reasoning dependency preventing indigenous legal development.

This is not translation difficulty solvable through dictionaries, judicial training deficits addressable through education, or temporary linguistic lag that time will cure. It is fundamental philosophical incompatibility between liberal individualist legal concepts and collectivist cultural frameworks, structural semantic gaps at the level of language, and institutional failure to support indigenous legal development.

The implications are profound. After 165 years since the Indian Penal Code, Indian regional languages still cannot express core legal concepts independently. The question is not whether we can translate English legal concepts into Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Bengali. The question is whether law can exist meaningfully in multiple languages when legal reasoning itself is linguistically bound to English. This research suggests the answer is no, not without fundamentally reimagining law in indigenous conceptual frameworks, which India has not done in 165 years and shows no signs of beginning.

The multilingual promise of the Indian Constitution remains unfulfilled at the level of legal reasoning. The Indian legal system is multilingual in form but English in substance. India must choose: commit to genuine multilingual legal development over 50 years with massive investment, acknowledge English-only reality with robust interpretation and legal aid, or abandon the current translation pretense that this research demonstrates does not work. There is no fourth option. The constitutional guarantee of linguistic equality demands a choice, and empirical evidence now exists to inform that choice.
