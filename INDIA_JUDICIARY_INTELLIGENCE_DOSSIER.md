### Indirect Political Connections

#### Advocate General Positions
Many SC judges served as Advocate Generals (top legal advisor to state governments), creating:

- Involvement in politically sensitive cases
- Networks within ruling party legal wings

#### Collegium System & Political Influence

- Operates in complete opacity

**Criticisms:**

- Family connections influence recommendations

- No records of deliberations published

**Failed Reform Attempt:**

- Judges appointed during specific political regimes
- Questions about potential bias in politically sensitive cases

**Lack of Disclosure:**

## Business & Corporate Relationships

### Critical Gap in Transparency

**What MPs Must Disclose (But Judges Don't):**

4. Paid consultancies
5. Professional engagements

**What Judges Are NOT Required to Disclose:**

**Failed Legislation:**

- Would have mandated asset declarations
- **Lapsed with dissolution of 15th Lok Sabha**
- **Never reintroduced** despite public demand

### Known Business Connections (Limited Data)

**Problems with Current System:**

1. **No Legal Requirement:** Disclosure is purely voluntary
2. **No Standard Format:** Each judge can disclose differently
3. **No Public Access:** Even disclosed information is kept confidential
4. **No Verification:** No mechanism to verify accuracy
5. **No Updates:** No requirement to update disclosures
6. **No Penalties:** No consequences for non-disclosure or false disclosure
7. **No Recusal Rules:** Conflicts of interest not addressed

**Impact on Justice System:**

- **Unknown conflicts of interest** in corporate cases
- **Potential bias** in cases involving family business interests
- **No accountability** for wealth accumulation
- **Public trust erosion** due to lack of transparency
- **Perception of elite privilege** protected by opacity

#### 3-8. **Subsequent CJIs**

### Appointment Process - The Collegium System

**Current System (Since 1993):**

**Composition:**
- Chief Justice of India
- 4 senior-most Supreme Court judges

**Process:**
1. Collegium meets (no public records)
2. Discusses candidates (no minutes published)
3. Reaches consensus (no voting records)
4. Sends recommendation to Government
5. Government generally accepts (but can return for reconsideration)

**Problems:**
- **Zero transparency:** No records of deliberations
- **No diversity criteria:** Appointments perpetuate existing demographics
- **Family favoritism:** "Uncle Judge Syndrome" documented
- **No external input:** Legal community, public excluded
- **No objective criteria:** Arbitrary selection based on personal relationships

**Recent Controversies:**

**May 2025 Appointments:**
- **14 candidates related to sitting/retired judges** among recent appointments
- **12 out of 170 approved HC appointees** had familial ties
- Appointments proceeded despite transparency concerns
- No explanation provided for family connections

**Lack of Representation:**

**Gender:**
- Only 1 woman out of 34 SC judges (2.9%)
- Only 1 woman will serve as CJI (for 36 days)

**Caste/Community:**
- Only 2 CJIs ever from Scheduled Castes
- Over-representation of upper castes
- Under-representation of OBCs, SCs, STs, minorities

**Regional:**
- Some High Courts never represented at SC
- As of May 2025, 6 out of 25 High Courts have no representation
- Geographic concentration in specific states

### Retirement Schedule (Known Retirements 2025-2030)

**2025 Retirements:**
- Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia - August 9, 2025
- Justice B.R. Gavai - November 23, 2025

**2026 Retirements:**
- Justice Jitendra Kumar Maheshwari - June 28, 2026

**2027 Retirements:**
- Justice Surya Kant - February 9, 2027
- Justice Vikram Nath - September 23, 2027
- Justice B.V. Nagarathna - October 29, 2027

**2030 Retirements:**
- Justice Dipankar Datta - February 8, 2030
- Justice J.B. Pardiwala - August 11, 2030

Each retirement creates vacancy, potentially filled through collegium system with limited transparency.
